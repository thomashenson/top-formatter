## Python Top Formatter

Simple Python script to output the result of the Linux top command to a file of desired type to the current directory. Specifically .txt, .json or .html. Any other file extension is invalid. Improvements in progress for additional file types and better formatting.

### Usage

```
from top_formatter import top_formatter

output = top_formatter("txt")
```
